      <h1 class="display-3">max-diff album ranking</h1>
      <h1 class="display-5">a brief explanation, shamelessly stolen from reddit</h1>
      <p class="text-justify">For a variety of reasons, we usually don't really like
        traditional ranking methods where each participant assigns a rank number to
        each item because studies show that most people can't handle that task. Their
        top and bottom ranked items may reflect their true preferences, but it is a
        toss up if their middle ranked items actually reflect how they truly feel.
        Instead let's use a different technique called MaxDiff.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">MaxDiff is different from traditional rankings in the
        following ways: Instead of having everyone provide a straight ranking
        (i.e. album X is "1", album Y is "2"), participants instead are presented
        sets containing four teams. In each set they choose the album they feel
        is the best and worst of the four</p>
      <p class="text-justify">We can use some math (Hierarchical Bayes estimation
        procedure) at the end of the study to calculate a full ranking for each
        respondent. This ranking system has an advantage over traditional rankings
        in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="text-justify">Shows distance between ranks. The distance between
            items ranked 1 and 2 need not be the same as the distance between items
            ranked 3 and 4. This lets us see natural breaks in how teams are perceived,
            which allows us to group albums into TIERS</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="text-justify">More accurately reflects middle ranked teams. Research
             on research (yes, that is a real thing) shows that people aren't really
             able to rank a long list of items. They can tell you their top two or three
             items and their last few items, but it is a toss up if their middle ranked
             items really reflect their true preferences. This method gets around that
             by breaking the task down into sets of four, so that everyone's middle
             ranked items actually reflect their true opinions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="text-justify">Gives the analyst conducting the poll the ability
            to identify and throw out bad respondents that don't know enough about
            the teams to give meaningful opinions.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
